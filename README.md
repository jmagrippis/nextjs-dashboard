# Next.js App Router Course - Code-along with Johnny

Hello and welcome, I'm Johnny and this is my final result after going through the [Next.js App Router Course](https://nextjs.org/learn)!

## Livestreams

We livestreamed development across 3 episodes!

It was fun, and besides implementing according to the curriculum, we also discussed when we could diverge, when we **should** diverge, debugged a few errors... and of course highlighted some of the things the course gets right and teaches particularly well!
